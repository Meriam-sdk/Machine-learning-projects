# CO2 Emissions Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts CO2 emissions from vehicle features using various machine learning algorithms. It evaluates model performance and identifies the best approach for this regression task.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Models:** Includes training, testing, and tuning of:
  - XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
- **Feature Scaling:** Implements feature scaling for distance-based models like KNN and SVR.
- **Regression Task:** Designed to handle numerical and categorical vehicle features for predicting CO2 emissions.

## Why These Models?

- **XGBoost:** Known for speed, accuracy, and handling both linear and nonlinear data efficiently.
- **KNN:** Versatile for regression and classification, adapts to varying data densities.
- **SVR:** Robust against outliers and overfitting, offering excellent generalization capabilities.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```
2. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash

# Data Cleaning and Correlation Analysis

This project focuses on preprocessing and combining UK government datasets from multiple years (2019â€“2023) to prepare them for analysis. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and correlation analysis to identify trends and patterns.

## Features

- **Data Combination:** Merges datasets from 2019 to 2023 into a single DataFrame with an added "Year" column.
- **Data Cleaning:** Identifies and handles missing values and inconsistencies in the data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Introduces new features, such as the "Year" column, to facilitate analysis.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Explores relationships between features to identify significant patterns.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Data_cleaning_correlation_analysis.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Combine datasets.
   - Perform data cleaning.
   - Conduct correlation analysis and visualize the results.

## Key Results

- Combined datasets from multiple years into a single, consistent DataFrame.
- Introduced a new "Year" feature for longitudinal analysis.
- Cleaned data to remove inconsistencies, preparing it for further analysis.
- Identified key correlations among features to inform subsequent modelling steps.

## Structure

- **Section 1:** Data combination across years with feature engineering.
- **Section 2:** Cleaning missing values and resolving data inconsistencies.
- **Section 3:** Visualizing and analyzing feature correlations.

## Requirements
